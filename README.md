### 1. Project Structure
This project was structured based on the combination of packaging strategies (package by layer and feature). This combination would be
a better way for the further project development:
1. clear package layer
2. clear feature 
3. more readable, scalable and manageable
#### 1.1 Data
All data, including remote, local and data cache strategy, is residing in this layer

#### 1.2 Presentation
This layer locates View layer and ViewModel layer, divided by the package strategy of features.
this is very clear for developers to check out each features by the package name where includes activities, fragments
ViewModel and so on

#### 1.3 Others such as Util
This layer includes some helper class

### 2. Libraries and tools ðŸ› 

- Android Studio Dolphin
- plugins and dependency management organized in the project build.gradle file
- Kotlin
- Coroutines and Flow
- Architecture components [Room, ViewModel, DataBinding, LiveData]
- Dagger2 + Hilt. Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project
- Retrofit, OkHttp used to manage the process of receiving, sending, and creating HTTP requests and responses.
- Coil used for image loading
- Timber. This is a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
- Unit Testing [JUnit, Mockito, Espresso]


### 3. Architecture

The project uses MVVM [Model-View-ViewModel] architecture to have a unidirectional flow of data, separation of concern, testability, and a lot more.

### Note:
In data model, in order to make a better user experience, this project always retrieves data from local database [cache is always source of truth], which can always show some articles for users, regardless of with or without internet.
And the data from remote server will be saved into database first.
